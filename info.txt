Advantages:

1. Simplicity and Readability: Go has a clean and simple syntax, making it easy to learn and read.
2.  High Performance: Go compiles to machine code, making it faster than interpreted languages like Python.
                      No manual memory allocation like C, but still optimized with garbage collection.
                      Handles concurrency efficiently.

3. Built-in Concurrency Support: Uses goroutines instead of OS threads, making concurrency lightweight.
                                 Channels allow safe communication between goroutines.

4. Cross-Platform Compilation: Compiles into a single binary with no dependencies.
                               Can compile for Windows, Linux, macOS, ARM, and more using GOOS and GOARCH.

5. Strong Standard Library, like json, http/net, os, etc.

6. Excellent for Cloud & Microservices.
7. Secure and Safe: No manual memory management

Disadvantages:

1. Poor GUI Support
2. No Oops concept
3. Limited AI/ML Capabilities: Python is more better of this feature.

Performance: fast complilation & No need for a virtual machine (like JVM in Java) or interpreter (like Python).
